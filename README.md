# Password Generator (Homework 3)

This project is a password generator. It allows the user to choose the password length and whether they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters and then generates a random password for them. There are conditions on the length that requires it to be between 8 and 128 characters. If the user selections something above or below the limit the user is warned and then starts over. There is also some error handling so that the user must select at least one of the password criteria listed above to successfully generate a password.
